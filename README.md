# I've been expecting you, wanderer! :speech_balloon: 

## A little about me :open_book:
I'm a passionate senior software developer. Currently trying my best to improve my back-end skills, as well as my logical thinking, with the goal to someday be a reference at the area I'll be working at.

## Main skills in constant improvement :computer:
- **Development**
  - Kotlin :electron:
  - Java :electron:
  - Python :electron:
  - Spring Boot :electron:
  - Amazon Web Services :electron:
  - Kafka :electron:
  - Kubernetes :electron:
  - PostgreSQL :electron:
  - Docker :electron:
  
## Hobbies :space_invader:
I'm passionate about music, mainly synthwave and genres derived from metal, so I always carry my earphone around. On my spare time, I enjoy playing some games, mostly competitive online games, but I do enjoy a good offline adventure. When I'm not playing, I tend to be watching either a fantasy, adventure or dystopian sci fi movie.
