# I've been expecting you, wanderer! :speech_balloon: 

## A little about me :open_book:
I'm a computer science student at the Federal University of Uberl√¢ndia. Currently trying my best to improve my back-end skills, as well as my logical thinking, with the goal to someday be a reference at the area I'll be working at.

## Skills I'm improving :computer:
- **Development**
  - Kotlin :electron:
  - Spring Boot :beginner:
  - Android Studio :beginner:
  - Git :beginner:
  - Design Patterns
  - Clean code
  
## Hobbies :space_invader:
I'm passionate about music, mainly synthwave and genres derived from metal, so I always carry my earphone around. On my spare time, I enjoy playing some games, mostly competitive online games, but I do enjoy a good offline adventure. When I'm not playing, I tend to be watching either a fantasy, adventure or dystopian sci fi movie.
